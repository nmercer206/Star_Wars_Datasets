# Star_Wars_Datasets
Through a series of HTTP GET requests, this application pulls a series of fields from a planets dataset from a Star Wars API. It then prints the dataset out onto a csv file.
Currently working on broadening the amount of datasets the application can pull from, and displaying the requested datasets through the use of a CLI.
